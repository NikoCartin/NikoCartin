### Projects & Experiments

- **MarbellaCR**  
  *E-commerce site based in Costa Rica for imported Brazilian fashion by Lez a Lez (Urban Beachwear).*  
  I developed optimized code and implemented a fully customized WordPress site with WooCommerce integration. My work included Facebook catalog integration, custom styling, layout design, and graphic editing for key visuals. I also led the SEO optimization strategy to improve visibility and search performance in a competitive market.
